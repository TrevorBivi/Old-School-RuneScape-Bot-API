#### Example spin bot warning
This example bot is a proof of concept. If you want to run it a lot you should stop it for a few hours every now and then to simulate a human taking a break. Althought it's still a lot more human-looking than most bots that go undetected, I'd still recommend using the concepts displayed in the example to improve the humanness.
